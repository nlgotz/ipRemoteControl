# ipRemoteControl for Android

## About
This Android App allows you to remotely control tvs that have IP Control Capabilities. I have only tested this with a Sharp tv but it should work with other tv's that allow for IP Control.

## How To Run
I installed it on my phone through Eclipse. It's probably possible for me to package this up, but that's pretty low on my priority list.

## How it Works
All of the commands open a TCP socket with the TV, execute it, and then close the connection. Most of the instructions came from my tv's manual but a few (volume control primarily) came from other manuals that I was able to find that happened to work. If you're interested in any of the resources I used, feel free to ask.
